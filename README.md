# RPSLS
## Rock, Paper, Scissors, Lizard, Spock

### Rock Paper Scissors Lizard Spock is an expansion of the game Rock, Paper, Scissors. It was created by Sam Kass and Karen Bryla, but it was popularized in an episode of the Big Bang Theory called The Lizard-Spock expansion.

## The Rules
### 1.Scissors cuts Paper
### 2.Paper covers Rock
### 3.Rock crushes Lizard
### 4.Lizard poisons Spock
### 5.Spock smashes Scissors
### 6.Scissors decapitates Lizard
### 7.Lizard eats Paper
### 8.Paper disproves Spock
### 9.Spock vaporizes Rock
### 10.Rock crushes Scissors

#### While Rock-paper-scissor-lizard-Spock has a set of ten rules that logically determine who wins a round of RPSLS, coding up these rules would require a large number (5x5=25) of if/elif/else clauses in project code. A simpler method for determining the winner is to assign each of the five choices a number:

  * 0 — rock
  
  * 1 — Spock
  
  * 2 — paper
  
  * 3 — lizard
  
  * 4 — scissors
## Technologies
### I used Python to build this project.
